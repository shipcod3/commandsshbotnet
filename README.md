commandsshbotnet
================

- A command and conquer PoC mass SSH botnet
- Inspired by the mass ssh botnet in Violent Python Cookbook (my scratch for writing this ssh botnet)
- Allows you to send a command in running the script
- Created for educational purposes and as a sample pwnage script for a Metasploit module soon: https://github.com/shipcod3/IRC-Bot-Hunters

Instruction
===========
Before running commandsshbotnet.py try to test your pxssh module by running test_pxssh.py. If ever you are having this kind of error:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "ssh.py", line 8, in <module>
            s.login (hostname, username, password)
        File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pxssh.py", line 243, in login
            if not self.synch_original_prompt():
        File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pxssh.py", line 134, in synch_original_prompt
            self.read_nonblocking(size=10000,timeout=1) # GAS: Clear out the cache before getting the prompt
        File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pexpect.py", line 824, in read_nonblocking
            raise TIMEOUT ('Timeout exceeded in read_nonblocking().')

You can fix it by editing /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pxssh.py and add the following lines as indicated by the comment:

    def synch_original_prompt (self):

        self.sendline()     # add this line
        time.sleep(0.5)    # add this line
        self.read_nonblocking(size=10000,timeout=1) # GAS: Clear out the cache before getting the prompt #no need to add this
        time.sleep(0.1) #no need to add this
        self.sendline() #no need to add this
        time.sleep(0.5) #no need to add this

Sample usage
============
     python commandsshbotnet.py os "uname -a" - For command and control

     python commandsshbotnet.py info - Print info
